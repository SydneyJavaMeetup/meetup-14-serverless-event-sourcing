Serverless event sourcing and CQRS with Java
In this talk you'll get a brief introduction to event sourcing and CQRS. We'll talk about how these patterns can be used to build scalable and resilient distributed systems. Then we'll see a live demo showing just how easy it is to write and build such a system with Java and Spring Boot using Kalix, a serverless platform for building distributed systems.
